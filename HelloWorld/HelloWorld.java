// Note 0: Text preceded by "//" is ignored by the compiler
// Put comments in source code to help people understand the code better

// Note 1: The name of the class, in this case, HelloWorld,
// must be the same as the filename, in this case, HelloWorld.java
// By convention, class names start with capital letters, and
// each word in the class name is also capitalized
// All of the other letters in the class name are lower case

// Note 2: Every Java program must have a "main" method,
// which is the "entry point", that is, the place where the program begins

// Note 3: To display the output, "Hello, world!", 
// for now we will use System.out.println()
