 * description  : This program creates a 10x10 2d array of integers
 *				  by reading an input file (input.data),
 *				  prints the array and the sum of its contents,
 *				  prints the sum of column with indwx [3], and 
 *				  prints the index number of the row with largest sum.
 *				  The purpose of this program is to demonstrate concepts
 *				  of multidimennsional arrays in Java.
 *
 * input        : ten integers in an input file
 * processing   : The program does the following. 
 *      		  1. declare 10x10 2d array
 *      		  2. populate 10x10 2d array with random integers 
 *      		  3. print the array
 *      		  4. print the sum
 *      		  5. print sum of column with index [3]
 *      		  6. print index number of row with largest sum
 * output       : printed 10x10 array of random integers and sum
 *
 * precondition : an input file must exist in the same directory as
 *				  the directory in which the program executes
 * postcondition: information printed to the screen, 
 * 				  as listed in processing items 3 through 6, above.
